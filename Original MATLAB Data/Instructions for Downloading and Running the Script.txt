Instructions for Downloading and Running the Script
1-Select download all files from the Mendeley Data page (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/cp3473x7xv/2). 
2-The files will be downloaded as a zip file.  Unzip the file to a folder, do not modify the folder structure. 
3-Navigate to the folder with "FNN_xEV_Li_ion_SOC_EstimatorScript_March_2020.mlx"
4-Open and run "FNN_xEV_Li_ion_SOC_EstimatorScript_March_2020.mlx"
5-The matlab script should run without any modification, if there is an issue it's likely due to the testing and training data not being in the expected place.
6-The script is set by default to train for 50 epochs and to repeat the training 3 times.  This should take 5-10 minutes to execute.
7-To recreate the results in the paper, set number of epochs to 5500 and number of repetitions to 10.


The FNN results using the prepared dataset "LGHG2@n10C_to_25degC", and script "FNN_xEV_Li_ion_SOC_EstimatorScript_Jan_2020" may present small variations from the results presented in the paper [1].
It may require to train the FNN several times as discussed in the paper as well. For more information refer to the paper [1].
